						After a tiring weekend of sightseeing, we ended our weekend trip to San Francisco by indulging in copious amounts ice cream and chocolate at Ghirardelli’s. 
						Armed with our Canon and Nikon SLRs, and even just an Iphone for one of us, we had more than 500 pictures of the iconic City by the Bay. 
						We spent the next week processing our pictures and keeping at bay (no pun intended) the over-enthusiastic friends and family who wanted us to post the pictures on our favorite social networking sites. 
						When we did eventually finish our work on the photos and shared them with everyone, we noticed how different our pictures were from each others’. We had visited the same sites, had captured the same views from almost the exact same positions, but the end results were far from being the same. 
						It was clear that our cameras weren’t the only element that set us apart on our photography trip.
					</br>
					</br>
						Our photo editing skills varied from being an amateur at Instagram to an expert at Photoshop and Lightroom, although most of us were somewhere in the middle. 
						Each of us also had a set of quirks that heavily influenced the outcome of the editing process, from too much contrast and noise reduction, to heavy vignettes and over saturation. 
						It was fascinating to see, in most cases where we had similar photos, each of us liked a photo that someone else had edited. 
						We found out that the photo editing quirks were based not only on personal preferences, but also our skillset and the time it took to employ. 
						Afterall, our busy schedules gave us barely enough time to pursue our photography hobby. 
						Many of our fellow photography enthusiasts had the same dilemma - we would all like to spend more time taking photos and less time processing the images. 
						Wouldn't it be awesome to leave the processing to the experts, whether enthusiasts like ourselves, or professionals ? That was the inception of thepurplebooth.com.
 					</br>
 					</br>
						While the idea to start thepurplebooth.com was a stereotypical AHA moment, the journey since then has been a start contrast. 
						Our busy schedules along with personal and professional commitments have been a greater challenge than we expected. 
						But our passion for photography and entrepreneurship as well as the nerd skills we have acquired through a combined 25 years of engineering experience drove the creation of thepurplebooth.com.
 					</br>
 					</br>
						Through thepurplebooth.com we wish to bring together photographers and photo editors, ametuers and experts alike, and give them an opportunity to share and showcase their skills and talents.
